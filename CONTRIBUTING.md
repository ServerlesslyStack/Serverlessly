## How and What to Contribute

- **Ideas:** Participate in Ideas threads in [Serverlessly Discussions -> Ideas](https://github.com/ServerlesslyStack/Serverlessly/discussions/categories/ideas) or start your own thread to have your voice heard.

- **Bugs:** Report bugs by starting a new thread in [Serverlessly Issues](https://github.com/ServerlesslyStack/Serverlessly/issues) (always search the issues first in case the bug has already been reported). [DO NOT REPORT SECURITY VULNERABILITIES AS ISSUES](./SECURITY.md).

- **Docs:** Fix typos and clarify language in documentation markdown files (`*.md`) or [TSDOC](https://github.com/microsoft/tsdoc) of code files by opening [Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) from a forked repo.

## Setting up development environment

2. [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/github/using-git/which-remote-url-should-i-use) the forked repo.

3. [Install Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) if it's not already installed (npm is NOT supported).

4. Run `yarn` command which will setup your environment.

For best experience, use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) IDE & install all [extensions recommended by this project](./.vscode/extensions.json).

## Before opening Pull Request on GitHub

Run the following command & make sure that everything checks out okay:

```sh
yarn test && yarn lint && yarn format
```

## Pull Request

It's always useful to communicate in advance through [Serverlessly Discussions](https://github.com/ServerlesslyStack/Serverlessly/discussions/), because sometimes, someone is already working in this space, so maybe it's worth collaborating with them instead of duplicating the efforts.

Pull Request titles are required to follow `Serverlessly Commit specification` which extends [Conventional Commit specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) and overrides types enum. For example, type `build`, `ci` from Conventional Commit specification have been replaced with `devops`. Complete set of types & scopes can be found [here](./.github/semantic.yml).

It's a good idea to indicate that work is in progress before you're ready to merge. This can be done by putting ðŸš§ emoji, WIP or Work in Progress (usually as suffix) in the PR title.

If the PR fixes a bug, write "Fixes #123" in the body without quotes where 123 is issue number. If an issue doesn't exist for the bug, create that first. If the PR implements a feature, write "Closes #123" in the body without quotes where 123 is issue number.
