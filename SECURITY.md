# How to report security vulnerability

[Responsible Disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure)

Never disclose security vulnerabilities publicly in [Issues](https://github.com/ServerlesslyStack/Serverlessly/issues) until it's fixed and most of users have upgraded to the patched version.

Reach out to `security@serverlessly.dev`. We'll work together on patching the vulnerability and follow some form of Responsible Disclosure once fixed.
